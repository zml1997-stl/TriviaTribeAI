    Requirements:
    - The question should be engaging, specific, and of average difficulty, similar to a standard trivia game.
    - The answer must be accurate and verifiable.
    - Provide four multiple-choice options: one correct answer and three plausible but incorrect distractors. At least one of these should be very plausible. 
    - Do not repeat, hint at, or include any part of the answer within the question. The wording should not make the correct answer obvious.
    - Ensure the question is broad enough that an average person might reasonably know or guess it if it is super specific.
    - Ensure the "{topic}" is not the answer to the question. 
    - The wording should feel natural and match the style of a well-crafted trivia question.
    - Keep the question modern and widely recognizable unless the topic requires historical context or are super specific topics. 
    - Return your response strictly in the following JSON format, with no additional text outside the JSON:
